OpenAI Five
2016–2019


At OpenAI, we’ve used the multiplayer video game Dota 2 as a research platform for general-purpose AI systems. Our Dota 2 AI, called OpenAI Five, learned by playing over 10,000 years of games against itself. It demonstrated the ability to achieve expert-level performance, learn human–AI cooperation, and operate at internet scale.

#AI bots just beat humans at the video game Dota 2. That’s a big deal, because their victory required teamwork and collaboration – a huge milestone in advancing artificial intelligence.

You play against [OpenAI Five] and you realize it has a playstyle that is different. It’s doing things that you’ve never done and you’ve never seen. Sometimes it looks extremely silly. But then again, are you going to be human and be like "Hey, this looks very stupid, this is bad" or [do] you try to take it to next steps, like "Why is it doing this?"
One key learning that we took is how it was allocating resources. It’s just allocating resources as efficiently as possible. And then you realize that we’re guilty of being stuck in a team dynamic, whereas sometimes we have to be way more flexible. […] If OpenAI does that dynamic switch at 100%, we maybe went from 5% to 10%? But that is already a difference—we’ve noticed it.

Finished training of a new agent, Rerun, which reached a 98+% win rate against the agent that played at Finals. This was completed in 2 months, without surgery, and while utilizing only 20% of the resources.

I don't believe in comparing OpenAI Five to human performance, since it's like comparing the strength we have to hydraulics. Instead of looking at how inhuman and absurd its reaction time is, or how it will never get tired or make the mistakes you'll make as a human, we looked at the patterns it showed moving around the map and allocating resources.
In terms of what OpenAI has done for us and how it influenced our run at TI9, one of the many curious patterns was the buyback and pressure play that happened in most of the games. We had a lot of talks about fighting and pressuring and how it used a different approach from any human in the past. As people, it's about being realistic and learning from the brain of the AI and not the hydraulic strength that machines have.
