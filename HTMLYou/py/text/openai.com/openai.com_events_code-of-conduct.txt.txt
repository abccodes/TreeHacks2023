OpenAI events are meant for networking, collaboration, and fun with
others in the machine learning and engineering communities.

We value the participation of each member of the community and want
all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling
experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect
and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all
conference events.

To make clear what is expected, all attendees of any OpenAI event are
required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will
enforce this code throughout the event.

The Short Version
-----------------

OpenAI is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do
not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and
imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave
professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or
exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for OpenAI events.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference
at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.
