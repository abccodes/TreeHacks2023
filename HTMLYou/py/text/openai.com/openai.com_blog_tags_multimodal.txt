Multimodal




A long-term objective of artificial intelligence is to build “multimodal” neural networks—AI systems that learn about concepts in several modalities, primarily the textual and visual domains, in order to better un­der­stand the world. In our latest research an­nounce­ments, we present two neural networks that bring us closer to this goal.
The first neural network, DALL·E, can successfully turn text into an appropriate image for a wide range of concepts expressible in natural language. DALL·E uses the same approach used for GPT-3, in this case applied to text–image pairs represented as sequences of “tokens” from a certain alphabet.
The second, CLIP, has the ability to reliably perform a staggering set of visual recognition tasks. Given a set of categories expressed in language, CLIP can instantly classify an image as belonging to one of these categories in a “zero-shot” way, without the need to fine-tune on data specific to these categories, as is required with standard neural networks. Measured against the industry benchmark ImageNet, CLIP outscores the well-known ResNet-50 system and far surpasses ResNet in recognizing unusual images.
We believe that these neural networks represent a meaningful step toward multimodal AI systems.
