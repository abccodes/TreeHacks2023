About









      OpenAI is an AI research and deployment company. Our mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.
    













      OpenAI’s mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)—by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work—benefits all of humanity.
      

      We will attempt to directly build safe and beneficial AGI, but will also consider our mission fulfilled if our work aids others to achieve this outcome.
